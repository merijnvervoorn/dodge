# 🏛️ DODGE: Department of Dutch Government Efficiency

Parody of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) page with Dutch data. The project was created to see if Elon has a point with his criticism of the efficiency of the American government. If so, then maybe it is time to create the Department of Dutch Government Efficiency. If not, then maybe we shouldn't take Elon so seriously.

## 🎯 Purpose

The Department of Dutch Government Efficiency (DODGE) is a satirical project inspired by Elon Musk's critiques of U.S. government efficiency.  

Our goal is to explore whether Dutch government efficiency stands up to scrutiny—or if Elon might actually have a point.  

### Key Questions:
- Does the Dutch government operate more efficiently than its American counterpart?  
- Should we establish DODGE to ensure optimal performance?  
- Or should we just stop taking Elon so seriously (assuming we ever did)?

## 📊 Features & Methodology

DODGE will analyze real Dutch government data to assess:
- **Spending vs. Outcomes** → Are we getting value for taxpayer money?  
- **Bureaucratic Processes** → Is the system streamlined or a maze of inefficiency?  
- **Comparisons to the U.S. Government** → How do we stack up?  

Our analysis uses **data-driven methods** to determine if Dutch governance is:
✅ *Super efficiënt* → No need for DODGE 🚀  
❌ *Hopeloos bureaucratisch* → DODGE is needed! 💸
