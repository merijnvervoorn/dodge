        In this game, you are a prototype AI tool called <strong>EFFISHNT</strong>. This tool is being tested by the HR manager of <strong>Optimyze</strong>, a company that creates digital tools for public institutions. EFFISHNT is secretly used internally by the manager of HR to decide who to fire in search of efficiency within the company.

      <p class="text-lg mb-6">
        Your task is to assess 10 employees based on the 5 bullet points they submit about their work over the past two weeks. For each employee, you have four decisions to choose from:
      </p>

      <ul class="text-lg mb-6">
        <li>üî• Fire</li>
        <li>üôå Not Fire</li>
        <li>‚¨áÔ∏è Decrease Salary</li>
        <li>‚¨ÜÔ∏è Increase Salary</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text-lg mb-6">
        Your choices will affect three key metrics:
      </p>
      
      <ul class="text-lg mb-6">
        <li>Efficiency</li>
        <li>Company Valuation</li>
        <li>Public Perception</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text-lg mb-6">
        Be mindful of the balance‚Äîmake smart decisions to optimize the team, but avoid damaging morale or the company's reputation. Good luck!

            <h1 class="white text-3xl mb-4">Why this game?</h1>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                This game serves as a commentary on the use of AI in employee evaluations and efficiency-driven agendas. The DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency) is allegedly attempting to implement AI to assess the performance of government workers, and this game explores why that could lead to significant problems. It highlights the dangers of relying on technology to make complex, human-centered decisions, such as firing employees based on arbitrary performance metrics.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                It invites players to reflect on the challenges of balancing efficiency, fairness, and empathy in decision-making within organizations. The game emphasizes that a simple list of 5 bullet points is insufficient to evaluate an employee's true value to a business. Such important decisions should not be left to AI.
            </p>

        <div class="justice-section text-center mb-12">
            <h2 class="white text-2xl mb-4">Justice as Fairness</h2>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                This game draws on philosopher John Rawls‚Äô concept of <em>Justice as Fairness</em> to explore ethical decision-making in the workplace. The framework encourages us to consider fairness from a position of equality‚Äîimagining what decisions would look like if we didn‚Äôt know our own role or status in the system.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                In the context of the game, players must weigh the consequences of firing or rewarding employees without full knowledge of their backgrounds or personal circumstances. This mirrors the ‚Äúveil of ignorance‚Äù thought experiment, challenging players to think beyond metrics and ask: what would be fair if roles were reversed?
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                By embedding this ethical lens, the game invites reflection on how fairness, transparency, and empathy must guide decisions‚Äîespecially when technology is involved in shaping human outcomes. Try filling in the quiz in a way where you would be happy with the outcome if you were the employee being evaluated. Would you want to be fired based on a list of 5 bullet points? Or would you prefer a more nuanced evaluation that considers your unique contributions and circumstances?
