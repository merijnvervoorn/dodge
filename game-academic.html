      <p class="text-lg mb-4">
        <strong>EFFISHNT</strong> is a game that tries to spread awareness about the use of AI in employee evaluation. The game is part of the <strong>Department of Dutch Government Efficiency (DODGE) project</strong>. This project looks at the actions of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Musk has been known for using AI inhis companies, and is allegedly willing to use AI to fire employees. He has asked all government workers to send in 5 bullet points about their work in the past two weeks (NBC News, 2025). The game has been created to show that the five bullet points that employees submit about their work are not enough to make a fair decision about their performance. Other news articles have shown that AI has been used by companies to fire employees (Forbes, 2023; ABC News, 2023). 

        <br><br>

        The default ethical framework for the game is based on <strong>Utilitarianism</strong>. Utilitarianism is an ethical theory that states that happiness should be the moral standard for all actions (Shaw, 1998). The term was first coined by Jeremy Bentham in the 18th century. Bentham's utilitarianism is based on the principle of utility, which states that the best action is the one where "... the tendency it has to augment the happiness of the community is greater than any it has to deminish" (Bentham, 1789). In the case of this company the goal is to maximize efficiency, making the employees (That are not fired) and external stakeholders happy.

        <br><br>

        The user is also encouraged to think about their actions using a different ethical framework. <strong>Justice as Fairness</strong> is based on the idea that fairness is the most important principle of justice. This theory was developed by John Rawls in the 20th century. Rawls argues that a just society is one where everyone has equal access to opportunities and resources, and that inequalities should only exist if they benefit the least advantaged members of society (Rawls, 1958). In the case of this company, this means that the employees should be treated fairly and that their performance should be evaluated based on more than just the five bullet points they submit.
        <br>
        Justice as Fairness also includes the theory of the veil of ignorance. This theory states that when making decisions about the structure of society, we should do so from a position of ignorance about our own social status. This means that we should not know whether we are rich or poor, educated or uneducated, or any other characteristic that could influence our decisions. By doing this, we can ensure that our decisions are fair and just for everyone (Rawls, 1958). This practice can also be implemented in the game. The user can imagine themselves being one of the employees that is being evaluated. This can help the user to think about the consequences of their decisions.

        <br><br>

        Chen et al. (2021) have shown that AI can be used to predict the performance of employees based on their competencies. This AI is used to predict the competency of personell to optimize their performance. This model shows that AI can be used to evaluate employees, however it is important to note that the model is based on the assumption that the AI is trained on a large dataset of employee performance data. This means that the AI is only as good as the data it is trained on, and that it may not be able to accurately predict the performance of employees who are not similar to those in the training dataset. This is a problem because it can lead to biased decisions about who to fire and who to keep.
        <br>
        Qin et al. (2023) have shown that the use of these tools should be done with caution and fair, ethical considerations in mind. They want to get an understanding of the complexities in layoff practices. Joseph (2024) argues that AI is perceived as more fair and more accurate than human managers. This shows that the use of AI in evaluation can also have positive influences on some employees.
