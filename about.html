        <p>By the authority vested in me as the Prime Minister by the Constitution and the laws of the Netherlands, it is hereby ordered:
            <br><br>Section 1. Purpose. This Executive Order establishes the Department of Dutch Government Efficiency (DODGE) to implement the Prime Minister's Efficiency Agenda, by modernizing governmental technology and software to maximize efficiency and productivity, because if it's good enough for Elon Musk's companies, it's good enough for us.
            <br><br>Sec. 2. Definitions. As used in this order:
            <br>(a) "Agency" means any governmental unit, excluding the Prime Minister's office or any components thereof.
            <br>(b) "Agency Head" means the highest-ranking official of an agency, such as the Minister, Director-General, or Secretary, unless otherwise specified in this order.
            <br><br>Sec. 3. DODGE Structure. (a) Reorganization and Renaming of the Dutch Digital Service. The Dutch Digital Service is hereby publicly renamed as the Dutch DOGE Service (DDS) and shall be established in the Office of the Prime Minister.
            <br>(b) Establishment of a Temporary Organization. There shall be a DDS Administrator established in the Office of the Prime Minister who shall report directly to the Prime Minister's Chief of Staff. A temporary organization known as "the Dutch DOGE Service Temporary Organization" is further established within DDS, in accordance with equivalent Dutch organizational regulations. The Dutch DOGE Service Temporary Organization, head by the DDS Administrator, shall be dedicated to advancing the Prime Ministerâ€™s whimsical 18-month DOGE agenda. This temporary organization shall terminate on July 4, 2026, but let's be honest, who expects lasting results from this venture anyway?
            <br>(c) DODGE Teams. In consultation with DDS, each Agency Head shall establish within their respective agencies a DODGE Team of at least four employees, potentially including Special Government Employees. These teams shall be hired or assigned within thirty days of this Order. Agency Heads shall select the DODGE Team members in consultation with the DDS Administrator. Each DODGE Team will typically include one Team Lead, an engineer, a human resources specialist, and an attorney. Agency Heads shall ensure that DODGE Team Leads coordinate their work with DDS and advise their respective Agency Heads on implementing the Prime Ministerâ€™s DOGE Agenda, because who better to implement efficiency than an overworked engineer and an underpaid lawyer?
            <br><br>Sec. 4. Modernizing Federal Technology and Software to Maximize Efficiency and Productivity. (a) The DDS Administrator shall begin a Software Modernization Initiative to improve the quality and efficiency of government-wide software, network infrastructure, and IT systems. Among other tasks, the DDS Administrator shall work with Agency Heads to promote interoperability between agency networks and systems, ensure data integrity, and facilitate responsible data collection and synchronization. It's like SpaceX, but with more paperwork and fewer rockets.
            <br>(b) Agency Heads shall take all necessary steps to ensure DDS has full and prompt access to all unclassified agency records, software systems, and IT systems, in coordination with the DDS Administrator and to the maximum extent consistent with law. DDS shall adhere to rigorous data protection standards, presumably protecting the data nobody will ever use.
            <br>(c) This Executive Order displaces all prior executive orders and regulations that might hinder providing DDS access to agency records and systems as described above, although it's hard to displace something already redundant.
            <br><br>Sec. 5. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:
            <br>(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or
            <br>(ii) the functions of the Director of the Ministry of Finance related to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.
            <br>(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations, because even good ideas need funding, and this may not be one of them.
            <br>(c) This order is not intended to create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the Kingdom of the Netherlands, its departments, agencies, entities, officers, employees, or agents, or any other person, since it's mostly for show.
            <br><br>THE HAGUE,
            <br>January 20, 2025.</p>
